## Quickstart with Docker
To set up Lightbug in one command:
1. Get [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or open the project in Codespaces where Docker is already installed:
   
   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/saviorand/lightbug_http)
2. Copy the contents of the `.mojoenv.example` file at the root of this repo into a new file called `.mojoenv`. 

   Replace `<your_modular_auth_token>` with your Modular access token (you can find it [here](https://developer.modular.com/download))
3. Run
   ```bash
   make lightbug
   ```

Lightbug will start and listen for requests on [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080). Enjoy!

## Overview

Lightbug is a simple and sweet HTTP framework for Mojo that builds on best practice from systems programming, such as the Golang [FastHTTP](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/) and Rust [may_minihttp](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp/). 

This is not production ready yet. We're aiming to keep up with new developments in Mojo, but it might take some time to get to a point when this is safe to use in real-world applications.

Lightbug currently has the following features:
 - [x] Pure Mojo networking! No dependencies on Python by default
 - [x] Set up a server to listen on a given host/port
 - [x] Assign your own custom handler to a route
 - [x] Craft HTTP requests and responses with built-in primitives
 - [x] Everything is fully typed, with no `def` functions used


We're working on support for the following (contributors welcome!):
 - [ ] Better error handling, improved form/multipart and JSON support
 - [ ] Multiple simultaneous connections, parallelization and performance optimizations
 - [ ] WebSockets, HTTP 2.0

The test coverage is also something we're working on.

The plan is to get to a feature set similar to Python frameworks like [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), but with better performance.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The only hard dependencies for `lightbug_http` are Mojo and [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git). 
Learn how to get up and running with Mojo on the [Modular website](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo).

Once you have Mojo set up locally,

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http.git
   ```
2. Switch to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd lightbug_http
   ```
   then run:
   ```bash
   mojo lightbug.üî•
   ```
   
   Open `localhost:8080` in your browser. You should see a welcome screen. 
   
   Congrats ü•≥ You're using Lightbug!
2. Add your handler in `lightbug.üî•` by passing a struct that satisfies the following trait:
   ```mojo
   trait HTTPService:
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        ...
   ```
   For example, to make a `Printer` service that simply prints the request to console:
   ```mojo
   @value
   struct Printer(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         let body = req.body_raw
         print(String(body))

         return OK(body)
   ```
   Routing is not in scope for this library, but you can easily set up routes yourself:
   ```mojo
   @value
   struct ExampleRouter(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         let body = req.body_raw
         let uri = req.uri()

         if uri.path() == "/":
               print("I'm on the index path!")
         if uri.path() == "/first":
               print("I'm on /first!")
         elif uri.path() == "/second":
               print("I'm on /second!")
         elif uri.path() == "/echo":
               print(String(body))

         return OK(body)
   ```
   
   We plan to add routing in a future library called `lightbug_api`, see [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.
3. Run `mojo lightbug.üî•`. This will start up a server listening on `localhost:8080`. Or, if you prefer to import the server into your own app:
   ```mojo
   from lightbug_http.sys.server import SysServer
   from lightbug_http.service import Printer


   fn main() raises:
      var server = SysServer()
      let handler = Printer()
      server.listen_and_serve("0.0.0.0:8080", handler)
   ```
   Feel free to change the settings in `listen_and_serve()` to serve on a particular host and port.

## Switching between pure Mojo and Python implementations
By default, Lightbug uses the pure Mojo implementation for networking. To use Python's `socket` library instead, just import the `PythonServer` instead of the `SysServer` with the following line:
```mojo
from lightbug_http.python.server import PythonServer
```
You can then use all the regular server commands in the same way as with the default server.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

<div align="center">
    <img src="static/roadmap.png" alt="Logo" width="695" height="226">
</div>

Our vision is to develop three libraries, with `lightbug_http` (this repo) as a starting point: 
 - `lightbug_http` - HTTP infrastructure and basic API development
 - `lightbug_api` - (coming later in 2024!) Tools to make great APIs fast, with support for OpenAPI spec and domain driven design
 - `lightbug_web` - (release date TBD) Full-stack web framework for Mojo, similar to NextJS or SvelteKit

The idea is to get to a point where the entire codebase of a simple modern web application can be written in Mojo. 

We don't make any promises, though -- this is just a vision, and whether we get there or not depends on many factors, including the support of the community.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues) and submit your own to help drive the development of Lightbug.
