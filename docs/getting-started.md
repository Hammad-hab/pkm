### Installing `pkm`

Installing pkm is a straight forward process mainly revolving around running a python script that sets up `pkm` in your computer. Following are the steps for downloading and installing pkm in your computer.

##### Attaining the installation script

Before actually installing pkm you need to have python3+ on your system along with `pip` or `pip3` because `pkm` is acutally running on python under-the-hood. After that you need to get the `install.py` present in the root directory of `https://github.com/Hammad-hab/pkm/` repo. If you don't want to
go through the process of downloading a raw file or copy-pasting it's contents you can run the following command to get the script into your computer:

`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hammad-hab/pkm/main/install.py > install.py`

##### Using the installation script

After the `install.py` has been downloaded on to your system run the file using the python interpreter. That's it! `pkm` will be automatically installed into your computer along with the certificate for accessing the package repository.
